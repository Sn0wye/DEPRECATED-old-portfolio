# Learnings
In this project, I learned some basic typing concepts with Typescript and how to use a CSS preprocessor, SASS, which helped both in productivity and in code clarity and maintenance.
It was my first time using some new dependencies like Emailjs and Swiper.js.

# Tecnologies && Dependencies Used:
- Vite
- Typescript
- React
- SCSS
- Swiper.js
