## This is my portfolio

# Learnings

In this project, I learned some basic typing concepts with Typescript and how to use a CSS preprocessor, SASS, which helped both in productivity and in code clarity and maintenance.
It was my first time using some new dependencies like Emailjs and Swiper.js.

# Tecnologies && Dependencies Used:

- Vite
- Typescript
- React
- SCSS
- Swiper.js
- Emailjs
- Supabase (for DB and API)
